<p><h2>An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.<p></h2><br><br>

			<p><h2>The kakapo, also known as the owl parrot (S. habroptilus), is a critically endangered bird endemic to New Zealand. Like many oceanic island-dwelling birds, the kakapo is flightless. Conservation efforts began in New Zealand over 125 years ago. Those efforts were only somewhat successful. Sadly, only 142 individuals are left in the wild as of 2019. Fortunately, the 2019 breeding season was extremely successful and 34 chicks are still alive! Efforts to restore their population have been successful, but the species still teeters on the brink of extinction.</h2></p>

			<p><h2>The Mariana fruit dove is an endangered (P. roseicapilla) bird native to Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. A host of threats has caused the native population of P. roseicapilla to shrink in recent years. Habitat loss and invasive species are the two largest threats to the rehabilitation of the fruit dove. There is a particularly strong urge to save the fruit dove as it is the official bird of the Northern Marianas Islands.</h2></p>

			<h1><font color="red">Hooded Grebe</font></h1>

			<p><h2>The hooded grebe (P. gallardoi) is a bird native to Chilean and Argentinian Patagonia. The main threat to P. gallardoi is predation by the American mink (N. vison). During the first year of the mink’s introduction, the population of the hooded grebe declined by half. Due to this decrease, the hooded grebe earned a spot on the IUCN critically endangered list. </h2></p>

			<h1><font color="red">Snowy Owl</font></h1>

			<p><h2>Most people will recognize the snowy owl (B. scandiacus) from the Harry Potter movie series. The snowy owl is currently considered ‘vulnerable.’ What’s worse, its population numbers are decreasing rapidly. These birds are particularly at risk due to their habitat. They primarily live north of the 60° latitude line. Due to melting polar ice caps, the prey that snowy owls feed on, like mice, are also disappearing. Combined with habitat loss, these factors have contributed greatly to the 85% decline in their population since 2003. </h2></p>

<p><h2>The great curassow (C. rubra) is a large bird known for its odd, lingering whistle-call. It is a vulnerable bird native to the rainforests of Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. Deforestation due to intense logging activity is the root cause of a decline in its population since the late 1980s. It is now listed as ‘vulnerable’ by the IUCN. </h2></p></center>
