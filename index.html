			<p><h2> Tigers are on the brink of extinction. Just over a century ago, 100,000 wild tigers roamed across Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 live in a mere four per cent of their historic range. The largest tiger population can now be found in India, home to half of all remaining wild tigers. Much of this decline has occurred in the past decade.</h2></p><br><br>

			<p><h2>The leopard’s range spans roughly 75 countries across much of Africa and Eurasia.

Likely the most persecuted big cat, leopards are listed as “Near Threatened” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, though they will almost certainly be uplisted to “Vulnerable” in 2015.

The leopard is classified as “Endangered” in Central Asia and Sri Lanka and “Critically Endangered” in the Middle East, Russia, and on the Indonesian island of Java.</h2></p><br><br>

<p><h2> Only 67 Javan rhinos are currently estimated to remain in the world, making this critically endangered rhino species one of the most threatened large mammal species on Earth. They’re confined to one park on the extreme southwestern tip of the Indonesian island of Java.<br>

<p><h2> For decades, mountain gorillas have been subjected to uncontrolled hunting, disease, habitat loss and the ravages of human conflict. Their numbers plummeted, and they are now considered endangered.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which sets the conservation status of species, changed their status from “critically endangered” to “endangered” in 2008 as their numbers improved.</h2></p><br><br>

<p><h2>The Asian elephant is classified as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its population has declined by an estimated 50 percent over the past 75 years, and there are an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Asian elephants left in the wild.<br>

The Asian elephant was listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1976. Because of their status under CITES and the ESA, commercial trade in Asian elephants and their parts and products is prohibited.</h2></p><br><br>
